## La autenticidad  

Se refiere a la característica de la comunicación, los documentos o cualquier dato que garantice la calidad de ser genuino o no corrupto. El papel principal de la autenticación es confirmar que un usuario es genuino. Los controles como la biometría, las tarjetas inteligentes y los certificados digitales garantizan la autenticidad de los datos, las transacciones, las comunicaciones y los documentos.


## No repudio

El no repudio es una forma de garantizar que el remitente de un mensaje no pueda negar posteriormente haber enviado el mensaje y que el destinatario no pueda negar haber recibido el mensaje. Las personas y las organizaciones utilizan firmas digitales para garantizar el no repudio.

Information warfare or InfoWar refers to the use of information and communication
technologies (ICT).


# 2 Cyber Kill Chain Concepts

The cyber kill chain is an efficient and effective way of illustrating how an adversary can attack the target organization. This model helps organizations understand the various possible threats at every stage of an attack and the necessary countermeasures to defend against such attacks. Also, this model provides security professionals with a clear insight into the attack strategy used by the adversary so that different levels of security controls can be implemented to protect the IT infrastructure of the organization. 

## Phases

The cyber kill chain is a framework developed for securing cyberspace based on the concept of military kill chains. This method aims to actively enhance intrusion detection and response. The cyber kill chain is equipped with a seven-phase protection mechanism to mitigate and reduce cyber threats. 



## Tactics 

Tactics describe the way the threat actor operates during different phases of an attack. It consists of the various tactics used to gather information for the initial exploitation, perform privilege escalation and lateral movement, and deploy measures for persistence access to the system. Generally, APT groups depend on a certain set of unchanging tactics, but in some cases, they adapt to different circumstances 

##  Techniques

To launch an attack successfully, threat actors use several techniques during its execution. These techniques include initial exploitation, setting up and maintaining command and control channels, accessing the target infrastructure, and covering the tracks of data exfiltration. The techniques followed by the threat actor to conduct an attack might vary, but they are mostly similar and can be used for profiling. Therefore, understanding the techniques used in the different phases of an attack is essential to analyzing the threat groups effectively.



## Procedures 

“Procedures” involve a sequence of actions performed by the threat actors to execute different steps of an attack life cycle. The number of actions usually differs depending upon the objectives of the procedure and the APT group. An advanced threat actor uses advanced procedures that consist of more actions than a normal procedure to achieve the same intermediate result. This is done mainly to increase the success rate of an attack and decrease the probability of detection by security mechanisms.

their contact details, identifies vulnerable systems and potential entry points to the target network, and documents all the collected information. The further actions of an adversary depend on the tactics used.

Adversary behavioral identification involves the identification of the common methods or techniques followed by an adversary to launch attacks to penetrate an organization’s network. It gives security professionals insight into upcoming threats and exploits. It helps them plan network security infrastructure and adapt a range of security procedures as prevention against various cyberattacks.

## What is TTPs, and IoCs ( en resumen)

Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs): an attacker's manifestation or modus operandi across technology, methodologies and operations. Discrete parts of an attacker's TTP can form specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) as if they were a fingerprint.

## Hacking Phases

In general, there are five phases of hacking:

1. Reconnaissance 
2. Scanning 
3. Gaining Access 
4. Maintaining Access
5.  Clearing Tracks

### Hacking Phase: Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance refers to the preparatory phase in which an attacker gathers as much information as possible about the target prior to launching the attack. In this phase, the attacker draws on competitive intelligence to learn more about the target.

***Reconnaissance techniques are broadly categorized into active and passive. ****

### Hacking Phase: Scanning

Scanning is the phase immediately preceding the attack. Here, the attacker uses the details gathered during reconnaissance to scan the network for specific information. 

### Hacking Phase: Gaining Access

### Hacking Phase: Maintaining Access

# Glosario 

## Dumpster diving

In cybersecurity is the process of investigating an individual or organization's trash to retrieve information that could be used to compromise network resources or plan a cyberattack. A person going through your trash can gather enough data to create a complex profile and commit identity theft.
